# AWS

- AWS is a platform of services.
- Common problems such as load balancing, queuing, sending email, and storing files are solved for you by services.
- Picking the right service to build the complex system is key to get benefit out of AWS platform.
- AWS provides api, using which all tasks can be automated, like create networks, start virtual machine clusters, or deploy a relational database.
- Scalability is the key benefit of AWS. AWS can scale from one virtual machine to thousands of virtual machines, storage can grow from gigabytes to petabytes.
- Scalabiltiy is not just about adding, we can remove capacity based on the usage.
- Most of the AWS services are highly available or fault tolerant.
- Services are available on demand, meaning that if we need additonal VM's, AWS provides it in few minutes.
- Global infrastructure
  - AWS offers data centers in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
  - Global infrastructure offers low network latencies between customers and infrastructure, being able to comply with regional data protection requirements, and benefiting from different infrastructure prices in different regions.
- Pricing
  - To calculate monthly the monthly cost of a planned setup, use AWS simple monthly calculator at http://aws.amazon.com/calculator.
  - AWS services are billed in different ways.
    - Based on minutes or hours of usage—A virtual machine is billed per minute. A load balancer is billed per hour.
    - Based on traffic—Traffic is measured in gigabytes or in number of requests, for example.
    - Based on storage usage—Usage can be measured by capacity (for example, 50 GB volume no matter how much you use) or real usage (such as 2.3 GB used).
