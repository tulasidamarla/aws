# Cloud Formation/Blueprint

- CloudFormation is based on templates called blueprints.
- A template is a description of infrastructure, written in JSON or YAML that can be interpreted by AWS CloudFormation service.

Benefits
-
- Consistent way to describe infrastructure on AWS, whereas with scripts everyone solves the same problem differently.
- Unlike scripts, dependencies are handled automatically.
- Can be replicated across different environments like test, production etc.
- Can be customized using paramters.
- Can be testable. It means start a new infrastructure, run tests and shutdown infrastructure.
- Can be updatable. CloudFormation figure out the parts of template that have changed and apply those changes.
- Human failures are minimized.
- Can be version controlled. CloudFormation uses Json/YAML document, so that versions can be maintained.
- CloudFormation is free. That means, if subscribed to an AWS support plan, CloudFormation service is free.

Structure
-
- CloudFormation structure consists of five parts.
  - Format version -> Defines the template version(Say 2010-09-09). Always recommonded to use because default uses latest version, which may cause issues if new versions are introducted in the future.
  - Description -> Text to describe the template.
  - Parameters -> Parameters are used to customize the template with values like domain name, customer ID, and database password etc.
  - Resources -> Any aws resource like VM, load balancer, elastic IP address etc.
  - Outputs -> It is similar to a paramter, but returns something from a template such as public name of an ec2 instance etc.
- Sample cloudFormation template format can be seen below.

Parameters
-
- A parameter has at least a name and a type. It is recommonded to use description also.
- A parameter can have 0 or more properties also.
- Name can be any chosen value. Types are AWS predefined types. Properties are also predefined.
  - Types
    - `String/CommaDelimitedList` -> A string or a list of strings separated by commas.
	- `Number/List<Number>` -> An integer or float, or a list of integers or floats.
	- `AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name/List<AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name>` -> An Availability Zone, such as us-west-2a, or a list of Availability Zones.
	- `AWS::EC2::Image::Id/List<AWS::EC2::Image::Id>` -> An Amazon EC2 image ID, such as ami-0ff8a91507f77f867 or a list of AMIs.
	- `AWS::EC2::Instance::Id/List<AWS::EC2::Instance::Id>` -> An Amazon EC2 instance ID, such as i-1e731a32 or a list of instance ids.
	- `AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName` -> An Amazon EC2 key pair name.
	- `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup::GroupName` -> An EC2-Classic or default VPC security group name, such as my-sg-abc.
	- `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup::Id/List<AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup::Id>` -> A security group ID, such as sg-a123fd85 or a list of security group IDs.
	- `AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id/List<AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id>` -> A subnet ID, such as subnet-123a351e or a list of subnet IDs
	- `AWS::EC2::Volume::Id/List<AWS::EC2::Volume::Id>` -> An EBS volume ID (network attached storage), such as vol-3cdd3f56 or a list of EBS volume IDs
	- `AWS::EC2::VPC::Id/List<AWS::EC2::VPC::Id>` -> A VPC ID, such as vpc-a123baa3 or a list of vpc ids.
	- `AWS::Route53::HostedZone::Id/List<AWS::Route53::HostedZone::Id>` -> An Amazon Route 53 hosted zone ID, such as Z23YXV4OVPL04A or a list of DNS zone IDs.
  - Properties	
    - Default -> A default value for the parameter. Ex: `Default: 'm5.large'`
	- NoEcho -> Hides the parameter value in all graphical tools (useful for passwords). Ex: `NoEcho: true`
	- AllowedValues -> Specifies possible values for the parameter. Ex: `AllowedValues: [1, 2, 3]`
	- AllowedPattern -> More generic than AllowedValues because it uses a regular expression. Ex: `AllowedPattern: '[a-zA-Z0-9]*'`
	- MinLength, MaxLength -> Defines how long a parameter can be. Ex: `MinLength: 12`
	- MinValue, MaxValue -> Used in combination with the Number type to define lower and upper bounds. Ex: `MaxValue: 10`.
	- ConstraintDescription -> A string that explains the constraint when the constraint is violated. Ex: `ConstraintDescription: 'Maximum value is 10.'`
- A parameter section of a CloudFormation template could look like this:

		Parameters:
		  KeyName:
			Description: 'Key Pair name'
			Type: 'AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName'
		  NumberOfVirtualMachines:
			Description: 'How many virtual machine do you like?'
			Type: Number
			Default: 1
			MinValue: 1
			MaxValue: 5
		  WordPressVersion:
			Description: 'Which version of WordPress do you want?'
			Type: String
		  AllowedValues: ['4.1.1', '4.0.1']

Resources
-
- A resource has at least a name, a type, and some properties.
- Name is the logical id of AWS resource that can be any chosen value. It must be alphanumeric (A-Za-z0-9) and unique within the template.
- Use the logical name to reference the resource in other parts of the template with syntax `!Ref name/logicalId`.
- Type represents AWS resource type and Property represents allowed properties for Resource. Resource type format is `service-provider::service-name::data-type-name`. For ex: `WS::EC2::Instance`.
- For complete catalog of resources and its properties visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html.
- Sample CloudFormation EC2 instance resource can be seen below.

		Resources:
		  VM:
			Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
			Properties:
			  ImageId: 'ami-6057e21a'
			  InstanceType: 't2.micro'
			  KeyName: mykey
			  NetworkInterfaces:
			   - AssociatePublicIpAddress: true
			   DeleteOnTermination: true
			   DeviceIndex: 0
			   GroupSet:
			   - 'sg-123456'
			   SubnetId: 'subnet-123456'

Outputs
-
- A CloudFormation templateâ€™s output includes a name and a value. It is recommonded to add a description as well. 
- Outputs are useful to pass data from within template to the outside.
- Sample CloudFormation template output can be seen below.

		Outputs:
		  ID:
			Value: !Ref Server
			Description: 'ID of the EC2 instance'
		  PublicName:
			Value: !GetAtt 'Server.PublicDnsName'
			Description: 'Public name of the EC2 instance

- The GetAtt is an intrinsic function which returns the value of an attribute from a resource in the template.
